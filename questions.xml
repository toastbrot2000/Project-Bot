      This is an interactive chat that will guide you through a series of questions. Your answers will help us determine the most likely visa category for your situation and provide a preliminary list of required documents.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Navigating the Chat:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Answering Questions:</b> Simply click on the option bubble that best fits your answer. Once you select an answer, it will be highlighted, and the next question will appear automatically.</li>
        <li><b>Editing Answers:</b> Made a mistake? No problem! Next to each of your selected answers, you'll see a small pencil icon (it looks like this: ✎). Clicking this will allow you to change your answer. Please note that changing an answer will reset all the questions that followed it.</li>
        <li><b>Session Resumption:</b> If you close the window and come back later, we'll remember where you left off! A dialog will ask if you want to continue your session or start over.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <strong>Understanding the Results:</strong>
      <br/>
      Once you've answered all the questions, you'll be taken to a results page. This page will show you the recommended visa category based on your answers and a checklist of documents you'll likely need to prepare.
