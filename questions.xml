    <text>Hey there 👋! First things first—what brings you to Germany?</text>
    <tooltip>
      <h2>Welcome to the Visa Helper Bot!</h2>
      Here's a quick guide on how to use this tool to find the right information for your journey to Germany. This modal is designed to hold a lot of text, just like this, and will become scrollable if the content exceeds the screen height.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>How It Works:</strong>
      <br/>
      This is an interactive chat that will guide you through a series of questions. Your answers will help us determine the most likely visa category for your situation and provide a preliminary list of required documents.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Navigating the Chat:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Answering Questions:</b> Simply click on the option bubble that best fits your answer. Once you select an answer, it will be highlighted, and the next question will appear automatically.</li>
        <li><b>Editing Answers:</b> Made a mistake? No problem! Next to each of your selected answers, you'll see a small pencil icon (it looks like this: ✎). Clicking this will allow you to change your answer. Please note that changing an answer will reset all the questions that followed it.</li>
        <li><b>Session Resumption:</b> If you close the window and come back later, we'll remember where you left off! A dialog will ask if you want to continue your session or start over.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <strong>Understanding the Results:</strong>
      <br/>
      Once you've answered all the questions, you'll be taken to a results page. This page will show you the recommended visa category based on your answers and a checklist of documents you'll likely need to prepare.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</strong>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Is this service free?</b> Yes, this tool is completely free to use. Our goal is to provide clear, accessible information.</li>

          <li><b>What happens to my data?</b> Your answers are stored temporarily in a cookie on your browser to allow for session resumption. We do not store your data on our servers. Clearing your cookies will erase your session.</li>
